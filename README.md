# EVM-System-v2

An asynchronous, event-driven Electronic Voting Machine backend written in Python. The system uses JSON-RPC over WebSockets, layered architecture, state machines, and append-only audit logs to simulate the backend components of a secure voting infrastructure.

> **Educational Project**
>
> This project is intended for learning backend engineering, asynchronous programming, networking, and system design concepts. It is **not intended for real-world elections**.

# Quick Start

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EVM-System-v2.git
cd EVM-System-v2
```

## Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Initialize Database

```bash
python database/init_db.py
```

## Start Server

---

# JSON-RPC Protocol

The system communicates using JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSockets.

## Example Request

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "cast_vote",
    "params": {
        "voter_hash": "f4ab7d4f1c8e...",
        "candidate_id": 3
    },
    "id": "e8d47f32"
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "status": "success"
    },
    "id": "e8d47f32"
}
```

# Security Features

## Voter Anonymity

Voter identifiers are hashed using SHA-256 before transmission and storage.

## Validation

All requests are validated using Pydantic schemas.

## Duplicate Vote Prevention

The system prevents multiple votes from the same voter.

## Immutable Audit Trail

Events are stored in an append-only hash chain.
